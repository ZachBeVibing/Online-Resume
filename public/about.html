<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey! I'm a developer in the process of learning many things. I currently go to ASU,
  majoring in Software Engineering, and also taking a Udemy course on Web Development.
  I don't have many skills on my belt at the moment, however, I'm always looking to learn!
</p>

<p>
  I'm into many hobbies, some simple, and some on the more, advanced side. Some of these hobbies include:
  <ul>
    <li>Coding</li>
    <li>Gaming</li>
    <li>Building Keyboards</li>
    <li>Art</li>
  </ul>
